# BoskR

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

This is a developing version of my R package to test adequacy of birth-death diversification models using metrics of tree shape derived from the tree’s modified graph Laplacian spectrum.

Once completed will be made available as a stable version on CRAN and a development version here.
